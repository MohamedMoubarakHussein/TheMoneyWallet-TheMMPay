Step 1: Transaction Initiation Flow
1. User initiates transaction via Gateway
2. Transaction Service receives request
3. Transaction Service publishes "transaction.initiated" event
4. Wallet Service consumes event and reserves funds
5. If successful, Wallet Service publishes "transaction.validation.result" (valid=true)
6. If insufficient funds, publishes "transaction.validation.result" (valid=false)

Step 2: Transaction Completion Flow
1. Transaction Service processes the transaction
2. On success, publishes "transaction.completed" event
3. Wallet Service consumes event and finalizes balance updates:
   - Releases reserved amount
   - Debits actual amount from sender
   - Credits amount to receiver
4. Wallet Service publishes "wallet.balance.updated" events
5. History Service consumes balance update events for audit trail
6. Notification Service sends balance update notifications
