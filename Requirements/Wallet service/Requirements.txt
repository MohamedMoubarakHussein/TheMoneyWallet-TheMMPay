A wallet service:
    As a user, I want to create a digital wallet and linked to my account so that I can manage my funds.
    As a user, I want to easily check my wallet balance so that I can monitor my funds.

Certainly! Designing the requirements for a microservices project like this involves both functional and non-functional aspects. Here's an outline for the wallet service:



Transaction History:
   - The service should maintain a record of all transactions made by the user.

Fund Transfer:
   - Users should be able to transfer funds from their wallet to another user's wallet.

Deposit and Withdrawal:
   - Allow users to deposit money into their wallet.
   - Enable users to withdraw money from their wallet.

Currency Support:
   - Support multiple currencies for transactions.

Transaction Verification:
   - Implement a secure verification process for each transaction.


Integration with Transaction Service:
    - Ensure seamless integration with the transaction service for recording financial transactions.
